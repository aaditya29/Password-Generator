#The secrets module is used for generating cryptographically strong random numbers suitable
#for managing data such as passwords, account authentication, security tokens, and related secrets.

#In particular, secrets should be used in preference to the default pseudo-random number generator in the random module,
#which is designed for modelling and simulation, not security or cryptography.

# Here, secrets.choice(sequence) returns a randomly-chosen element from a non-empty sequence.
